Region2vec: Community Detection on Spatial Networks Using Graph Embedding with Node Attributes and Spatial Interactions

**Abstract:** 
Community Detection algorithms are used to detect densely connected components in complex networks and reveal underlying relationships among components. As a special type of networks, spatial networks are usually generated by the connections among geographic regions. Identifying the spatial network communities can help reveal the spatial interaction patterns, understand the hidden regional structures and support regional development decision-making. Given the recent development of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and its powerful performance in identifying multi-scale spatial interactions, we proposed an unsupervised GCN-based community detection method "region2vec" on spatial networks. Our method first generates node embeddings for regions that share common attributes and have intense spatial interactions, and then applies clustering algorithms to detect communities based on their embedding similarity and geographic adjacency. Experimental results show that while existing methods trade off either attribute similarities or spatial interactions for one another, "region2vec" maintains a great balance between both and performs the best when one wants to maximize both attribute similarities and spatial interactions within communities.

## Requirements

Region2 uses the following packages with Python 3.7

numpy==1.19.5

pandas==0.24.1

scikit_learn==1.1.2

scipy==1.3.1

torch==1.4.0



## Usage

1. run train.py to generate the embeddings.
```
python train.py
```
2. run clustering.py to generate the clustering result. 

```
python clustering.py --filename your_filename
```
Here the 'your_filename' should be replaced with the generated file from step 1.

3. Alternatively, to generate the clustering for all the files, please use bash, and run bash run_clustering.py.

```
bash run_clustering.sh 
```
Notes: the final results (e.g., metric values) may vary depends on different platforms and package versions.
The current result is obtained using Ubuntu with all pacakge versions in requirements.txt. 

## Data
Will update more details on the data preprocessing and preparation (e.g., spatial flow interaction matrix/spatial weights, geographic adjacency matrix).
